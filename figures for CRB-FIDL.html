    <p>Hafa Adai and Merry Christmas<br>
    </p>
    <p>I have attached photo release forms from Michael Bohne, Trevor
      Jackson and myself. Michael's image file is <b>rhino_beetle_head.jpg</b>.
      Names of Trevor's and my files are listed on the forms.</p>
    <p>Images are stored in a public GitHub repository at
      https://github.com/aubreymoore/CRB-FIDL in the <b>images</b>
      folder.</p>
    <p>I provide a markdown file as an index to the figure images at
      https://github.com/aubreymoore/CRB-FIDL/blob/main/images/fig_list.md</p>
    <p>I also attached a copy of this markdown file for local use. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Figure 12 is really crappy and I will provide a replacement for
      this one.</p>
    <p>All the Best,</p>
    <p>- Aubrey<br>
