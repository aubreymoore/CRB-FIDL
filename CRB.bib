	volume = {9},
	abstract = {Wireless sensor network technology is widely used
in the western world for improving agriculture output. However,
in the developing countries, the adaptation of technology is very
slow due to various factors such as cost and unawareness of
farmers with the technology. There are reports in the literature
related to the precision agriculture and hopefully, this paper will
add to the knowledge of the use of Wireless sensor network
({WSN}) for monitoring agriculture fields for pest detection. The
literature related to pest monitoring and detection using wireless
sensor networking technologies are reviewed. Then, the advanced
sensing technologies are currently in use for the detection of a
pest has been described. The existing techniques about pest
detection and disease monitoring are evaluated on the basis of
some key parameters such as the type of sensors used, their cost,
processing tools, etc. Finally, the sensing technologies and the
possibility of using third generation sensing technology for
monitoring and detection of cotton crops are analyzed.},

A survey of adult beetles was carried out throughout Malaysia using pheromone traps. Captured beetles were examined for presence of virus using both visual/microscopic examination and {PCR} detection methods. The survey indicated that Oryctes virus was common in Malaysia among the adult beetles. Viral {DNA} analysis was carried out after restriction with {HindIII} enzyme and indicated at least three distinct viral genotypes. Bioassays were used to compare the viral strains and demonstrate that one strain (type B) is the most virulent against both larvae and adults of the beetle. Virus type B has been cultured and released into healthy populations where another strain (type A) forms the natural background. Capture and examination of beetles from the release site and surrounding area has shown that the spread and persistence of the applied virus strain is accompanied by a reduction in palm frond damage.},

In a laboratory colony maintained for production of Oryctes virus, an important biocontrol agent of this major coconut pest, approximately 52\% of the grubs succumbed to septicaemia with similar symptoms. The bacterium was found to be a component of the gut microflora of healthy grubs. Occurrence of the viral infection naturally or when induced in the laboratory in the O. rhinoceros grubs, appeared to be one of the biotic stress factors for P.alcaligenes to become an opportunistic pathogen. A preponderance of this bacterial infection in field populations during the periods when natural viral infection in grubs was above average, agrees with this observation. This finding becomes significant as infection by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen, P. alcaligenes , reduces the production of Oryctes virus inoculum in nature and limits the field-perpetuation of this viral biocontrol agent.},

	abstract = {Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important due to their role in recycling plant material and promoting nutrient turnover. However, some species are phytophagous and can attack crop plants, thus becoming pests. Here, we provide information on the biology and behavior of the rhinoceros beetle Enema pan (F.) (Oryctini), an abundant species in the area of Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Adults were collected with a light trap deployed daily from January 2006 to December 2007 in the experimental farm of the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (Aquidauana campus). Adults were maintained in plastic containers and observations were made daily. Temporal distribution of adults of E. pan occurred in September and October (2006) and from October to December (2007). Flight started at 1930 hours and ended at 2330 hours. Twenty-four eggs (3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width) with a whitish color were ovipositioned directly in to the soil. Adult longevity averaged 22.0 d in the laboratory conditions. Cephalic horn length, body length, and width of E. pan males are greater than those of females. The weight of adults of both sexes was similar. Cephalic horn length of the males of E. pan was positively correlated with his body size. Mating occurred between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted on average 18.1 min in the laboratory. Several fights among males and other behaviors involving males and females were observed and are reported. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

	abstract = {The {DSIR}-{HA}-1179 coleopteran cell line is a susceptible and permissive host to the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}), which has been used as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros); a pest of palms in the Asia-Pacific region. However, little is known about growth and metabolism of this cell line, knowledge of which is necessary to develop an in vitro large-scale {OrNV} production process. The strong anchorage-dependent characteristics of the cell line, its particular fragility and its tendency to form dense clumps when manipulated, are the most likely reasons that have precluded further development of the cell line. In order to characterize {DSIR}-{HA}-1179 cells, there was first a need for a reliable technique to count the cells. A homogenous cell suspension suitable for enumeration could be produced by treatment with {TrypLE} Express™ with optimum mean time for cell release calculated as 30 min. The cell line was adapted to grow in four serum-supplemented culture media namely {TC}-100, {IPL}-41, Sf-900 {II} and Sf-900 {III} and cell growth, glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production were assessed from static-batch cultures. The maximum viable cell density was reached in Sf-900 {II} (17.9 × 10(5) cells/ml), with the maximum specific growth rate observed in this culture medium as well (0.0074 h(-1)). Higher production of {OrNV} was observed in {IPL}-41 and {TC}-100 (4.1 × 10(7) {TCID}50/ml) than in cultures infected in Sf-900 {III} (2.0 × 10(7) {TCID}50/ml) and Sf-900 {II} (1.4 × 10(7) {TCID}50/ml). At the end of the growth period, glucose was completely consumed in cultures grown in {TC}-100, while remained in excess in the other three culture media. The cell line produced lactate and ammonia to very low levels in the {TC}-100 culture medium which is a promising aspect for its cultivation at large-scale.},

	abstract = {Pseudomonas alcaligenes was detected at a high concentration (10 9 -10 10 cells {mL} -1 ) in the haemolymph of some dead Oryctes rhinoceros grubs collected from its breeding sites in the three southern districts, viz. Alleppey, Quilon and Kottayam of Kerala State, India. In a laboratory colony maintained for production of Oryctes virus, an important biocontrol agent of this major coconut pest, approximately 52\% of the grubs succumbed to septicaemia with similar symptoms. The bacterium was found to be a component of the gut microflora of healthy grubs. Occurrence of the viral infection naturally or when induced in the laboratory in the O. rhinoceros grubs, appeared to be one of the biotic stress factors for P.alcaligenes to become an opportunistic pathogen. A preponderance of this bacterial infection in field populations during the periods when natural viral infection in grubs was above average, agrees with this observation. This finding becomes significant as infection by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen, P. alcaligenes , reduces the production of Oryctes virus inoculum in nature and limits the field-perpetuation of this viral biocontrol agent.},

	title = {Tracking Insects with Harmonic Radar: a Case Study},
	volume = {50},
	abstract = {Harmonic radar technology can be used to track the
dispersal of tagged insects. The tag consists of a wire antenna attached to a Schottky diode, which uses the original radar signal as
an energy source, re-emitting a harmonic of the transmitted wavelength. Two forms of harmonic radar use this basic technology to
study insect movement. The more sophisticated form consists of a
ground-based scanning radar station that tracks the movement of a
tagged insect on a circular radar display. A simpler, “off-the-shelf”
form of harmonic radar is a commercially available, light-weight,
handheld transmitter/receiver from {RECCO} Rescue Systems. We
briefly review both of these forms and describe our experience
monitoring the movement of carabid beetles in agricultural habitats
with the handheld transmitter/receiver. We identified a commercial
source of diodes compatible with the {RECCO} transmitter/receiver
and tested several diode and wire combinations. We found that a tag
built with a diode attached to a single section of 8-cm wire (monopole) was more appropriate for marking carabids. Tags built from
flexible Teflon-coated wires were an improvement on tags built with
stiff, aluminum wire, but beetle movement was still hindered. In corn
and soybean fields, large carabids (Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir and
Harpalus pennsylvanicus, ({DeG}.) Coleoptera: Carabidae) could be
recaptured even when they burrowed out of sight 3 to 9 cm below
the soil surface. We discuss the trade-offs between tag detection and
durability that occur when designing a tag for a given organism.
Although the technique shows promise, producing a tag that does
not hinder movement of the target insect in the field will require
further development.},

(Plot 3) years old from November 2015 to October 2016. From 3862 individuals, 110 species
and 83 morphospecies from 40 families and 59 subfamilies were successfully collected. From
all samples recorded, the five years old oil palm showed the highest Shannon Diversity Index
(H' = 3.42), Peilou Equality Index (E' = 0.23) and Margalef Richness Index (R’= 17.33) with
species accumulation curve near to asymptote. The most abundant species recorded from the
three sites was Elaeidobius kamerunicus with 940 individuals (relative abundance, {RA} = 24\%).
Plot 1 had the highest beetle species with 132 individuals (68.4\%), while Plot 2 was the lowest
with 85 individuals (44\%). The t-test analysis showed that there was no significant difference
in term of the diversity index (H’) between Plot 3 and Plot 2 (p-value=0.092), while there were
significant differences between these two plots (Plot 2 and Plot 3) with Plot 1 (p-value= 0.47 and 0.046). This study would provide basic information for future research in sustainable oil palm plantations management in Malaysia.},

	abstract = {The discovery of Oryctes nudivirus ({OrNV}) in the 1960s by Dr
Alois Huger enabled the successful management of coconut
rhinoceros beetle (Orytes rhinoceros) populations through
classical biocontrol release in the Pacific, {SE} Asian, and Indian
Ocean regions. {OrNV} continues to be an important biocontrol
agent for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros in both coconut and
oil palm growing regions. Augmentative release of {OrNV} is
commonly used to enhance the natural spread and ensure its
continued presence within palm growing regions and
surrounding areas. For over four decades after the distribution
of the virus, O. rhinoceros was not reported to have
established in any new regions. However, in 2007 the beetle
was discovered in Guam and the population has now
established with a highly damaging outbreak such as those not
seen for 40+ years. Initial attempts to introduce {OrNV} into the
Guam population were unexpectedly unsuccessful. This has
raised the possibility the O. rhinoceros population that invaded
Guam is less susceptible to {OrNV}, or potentially resistant.
Furthermore, near the end of 2013, a population of O.
rhinoceros was detected in Hawaii, although it is not believed
to have established yet. The discovery of new O. rhinoceros
invasions within the Pacific region linked with the possibility of
a virus tolerant population suggests the beetle may again be
on the move. To assist efforts in identifying the source
populations for the Guam outbreak, a simple {PCR}-{RFLP}
method has been developed to distinguish Guam O.
rhinoceros from other populations. Analysis of several O.
rhinoceros populations has demonstrated that the Hawaiian
beetles are of the same haplotype as those found in Guam.
We will discuss current results in relation to what is known
about these new invasions and potential implications for the
future.},

	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros; {CRB}) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}) in the 1960s has enabled the successful management of populations in Pacific Island Countries ({PICs}). Augmentative release of {OrNV} continues to be an important mechanism for {CRB} management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. For {\textasciitilde}40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy, no new outbreaks of {CRB} were reported from uninfested palm growing countries and islands in the Pacific ensuring continuity of palm based village economies. However, the situation has recently changed. For first time in {\textasciitilde}40 years, {CRB} invasion into completely new areas has been reported in the Pacific, being detected first in Tumon Bay in Guam 2007, followed by Port Moresby in {PNG} 2010, Honolulu in Hawaii 2013, and Honiara in Solomon Islands 2015. Additionally, Pacific areas with established {CRB} populations (e.g. Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of {CRB} damage. Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage, not seen since the introduction of {OrNV}. Initial attempts to introduce {OrNV} into the Guam {CRB} population were unexpectedly unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the {CRB}-G population that invaded Guam could be tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied {OrNV} isolates. Analysis of several {CRB} populations has demonstrated that the {CRB}-G biotype is also found in Hawaii, Palau, and recently (February 2015) in Port Moresby ({PNG}), with Honiara (Solomon Islands) still to be confirmed.

Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}). In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77\% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the {OrNV} disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on-site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP}) assay was thus tested. To avoid the {DNA} extraction process, the {LAMP} assay used a 50-fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on-site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the {OrNV} infectivity with {LAMP} primers targeting the {OrNV}\_gp102 gene. To evaluate the {LAMP} specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens, causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with {OrNV}. The positive results were detected only from the {OrNV}-infected larvae.},

	abstract = {Over the past 30 years radar has emerged as an essential tool for investigating the migratory flight of insects at high altitude, providing, as it does, a unique means of measuring their altitudinal distribution, speed, and direction, and even their orientation (Riley, 1989; Reynolds, 1988). Until recently, however, it was not practicable to apply this powerful technique to low-altitude "foraging" flights (defined by Kennedy, 1985), i.e., flights to find food, mates, egg-laying
sites, and other resource items (Bell, 1991). This is because the strong radar
echoes from ground features and vegetation ("clutter") usually mask the very
tiny returns from insects. In principle, this constraint can be overcome by using
the harmonic transponder technique first suggested in 1967 (Vogler et al., 1967) and subsequently investigated for automobile collision avoidance systems (Shefer et al., 1974). In this technique, the target to be tracked is "tagged" with an harmonic transponder, in the form of an electrically nonlinear conductor
(usually a diode) attached to some form of antenna. The transponder picks up
energy from the illuminating radar and reradiates some of it at an harmonic of the original frequency: the radar receiver is selectively tuned to this new frequency and so is able to detect the transponder even in the presence of very strong clutter.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Although portable harmonic radar system and fluorescent marking system are two widely used detection
methods, their comparative effectiveness has not been studied. Therefore, we first tested the applicability of fluorescent
marking system on Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae). Then, we evaluated the efficacy of the two methods used either
alone or combined in a grass field and bean field, varying with complexity, during day and night.
{RESULTS}: Fluorescent marking did not affect the behavior or fitness of Riptortus pedestris except for vertical walking, while
allowing the detection from {\textgreater}25 m when paired with a handheld laser. Generally, the portable harmonic radar system and both
methods combined were more successful in sample detection, although the fluorescent marking system in the bean field at night
was as competitive as the two. Combining both methods made sample retrieval easier at night than the portable harmonic radar
system. Nevertheless, the total detection time showed a large variance across the methods.
{CONCLUSION}: The portable harmonic radar system can be an effective detection method in either landscape during both day
and night. Furthermore, the fluorescent marking system can be a reliable tool at night as well. Lastly, combining both methods
can improve the night detection.

Infestation increased from 30\% in 1983 to 68\% in 1986. An attempt to control that pest mechanically and chemically was carried out in 1985 and 1986. A total of 6573 beetles could be extracted from 58630 infested trees that were treated with {BHC} at a concentration of (6.5\%). As a result of such treatment, the mean number of beetles/100 trees decreased considerably at three localities; Augad and El-Wadi, El-Dahariz and Tagah. Meanwhile, beetles population increased at Salalah and El-Hafa and El-Karad localities. Reduction of mean percent of infestation in 1985 and 1986 ranged 77-100\% according to locality.},

  in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea. This species causes severe economic impacts on coconut palms in young plantations. Flights to feeding, mating, resting, and possibly oviposition sites covered distances of 52 to 835 m in males, and from 245 m to {\textgreater}1000 m in females. Upon release, females flew in a tight upward spiral above canopy level ({\textgreater}20 m), then usually flew along a single bearing out of radio reception within 1 min of initiating flight. Dispersing females probably follow scent trails to pheromone-releasing males that occupy feeding galleries excavated most frequently in coconut palms, or search for oviposition sites. Most tagged females were not found again, because they dispersed beyond the tracking capabilities of our radio-receivers, but one female was followed for 245 m to a feeding gallery excavated by an adult male. Males typically flew within 5 m of the ground, took erratic flight paths with numerous turns, and frequently circled coconuts and other host plants. We followed males from the release point until they ceased flight for a night. Males passed daylight hours either in a feeding gallery within a host plant or under soil litter.},

Full genomes of field-caught {OrNV} isolates, and their infectivity against larvae and adults, could be compared with those of {HA}-cultured isolates. Further data to correlate {OrNV} dosage indices with doses in number of virions/ml could be advantageous so as to explore if {CRB} larvae or adults may resist infection by a sub-threshold dose. Also the possibility of changes in the {HA} culture cells which alter the outer coat of the resulting virion, hence perhaps its infectivity towards {CRB} cells, could be checked. Might it be possible to move beyond {HA}-culture and develop tissue culture of Oryctes rhinoceros cells for mass production of {OrNV} as this beetle species is the target? Nuclear genomes of {OrNV}-resistant and {OrNV}-susceptible strains of the {CRB} could be examined for changes perhaps correlated with resistance. The possibility of endosymbiotic bacteria affecting {CRB} susceptibility to {OrNV} might be checked.},

	volume = {143},
	abstract = {any forest-defoliating Lepidoptera exhibit long-term cyclic fluctuations in density that span several orders of magnitude. One hypothesis to explain these fluctuations is that they are driven by pathogens with long-lived infectious stages capable of surviving outside the host. The basis of the argument is that, for realistic parameter values, a mathematical disease model incorporating such an infectious stage is likely to show cycles with the same period as is observed in nature. The mathematical model used to make this argument, however, is so simple that it may not be biologically meaningful. In this article, I extend the original model by including two realistic complications: density-dependent host reproduction and host movement behavior. Including density-dependent host reproduction greatly increases the likelihood of cycles; addi tional realism thus strengthens the original conclusion. Including host movement behavior makes the model more versatile, as it allows comparison of the model output with literature data on the spatial spread of insect viruses. This comparison suggests that the spatial spread of the viruses of Gilpinia hercyniae and Oryctes rhinoceros can be explained with a very simple model of host movement, without recourse to complicated mechanisms of dispersal. The introduction of host movement behavior also introduces the possibility of cycles of outbreaks in space and time simultaneously-that is, waves of disease that will reappear at regular intervals.},

	abstract = {Oryctes nudivirus (species {OrNV}) has been an effective biocontrol agent against the insect pest Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) for decades, but there is evidence that resistance could be evolving in some host populations. We detected {OrNV} infection in O. rhinoceros from Solomon Islands and used Oxford Nanopore Technologies ({ONT}) long-read sequencing to determine the full length of the virus genomic sequence isolated from an individual belonging to a mitochondrial lineage ({CRB}-G) that was previously reported as resistant to {OrNV}. The complete circular genome of the virus consisted of 125,917 nucleotides, 1.698 bp shorter than the originally-described full genome sequence of Ma07 strain from Malaysia. We found 130 out of 139 previously annotated {ORFs} (seven contained interrupted/non-coding sequences, two were identified as duplicated versions of the existing genes), as well as a putatively inverted regions containing four genes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of a long-read sequencing technology for resolving potential structural variations when describing new virus isolates. While the Solomon Islands isolate exhibited 99.41\% nucleotide sequence identity with the originally described strain, we found several genes, including a core gene (vlf-1), that contained multiple amino acid insertions and/or deletions as putative polymorphisms of large effect. Our complete annotated genome sequence of a newly found isolate in Solomon Islands provides a valuable resource to help elucidate the mechanisms that compromise the efficacy of {OrNV} as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle.},

	volume = {103},
	abstract = {The impact of electronic dipole tags on the walking activity of three insects was
determined using video tracking software. Results varied within and between the three species
studied. The heaviest tag mounted on the pronotum of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa
decemlineata (Say), reduced its mean horizontal speed slightly but {signiÞcantly}. The mean horizontal
speed of plum curculio, Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst), was {signiÞcantly} reduced by a light tag but
not by heavier tags. The mean horizontal speed of the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera
virgifera ({LeConte}), increased slightly when a tag was attached. A tag mounted to the dorsum of the
Colorado potato beetle and the plum curculio slightly changed their climbing speed. Changes in the
walking speed were variable but remained well within the range of values recorded in the literature.
The impact of the additional tag weight was within the range of constraints to movement (e.g., slopes,
barriers, etc.) normally experienced by insects in their environment. The results {conÞrm} that tags
presently available will have minimal impact on the walking behavior of Colorado potato beetle,
provide an estimate of the optimal tag weight for the plum curculio and show that a lighter tag and
a better attachment method are required for the western corn rootworm. Because of the ability of
insects to adapt to a wide range of landscapes and to their own body weight changes, the additional
tag weight had a limited impact compared with the value of the ecological information gathered using
this technology.},

addition of vertical or trailing electronic tags to their body has generated concerns on the suitability
of harmonic radars to track the dispersal of insects. This study compared the walking behavior of adult
Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) Chrysomelidae), plum curculio (Conotrachelus nenuphar (Herbst) Curculionidae), and western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera

frequency of the larger Colorado potato beetles crossing bare ground or grassy plots was unaffected
by the presence of an 8 cm trailing harmonic radar tag. However, plum curculios and western corn
rootworms, were either unable to walk with a 4 cm trailing tag (plum curculio) or displayed a reduced
ability to successfully cross a bare ground arena. Our results revealed the {signiÞcant} impact of
vegetation on successful insect dispersal, whether tagged or not. The vertical movement of these
insects on stems, stalks, and tubes was also unaffected by the presence of vertical tags. Trailing tags
had a {signiÞcant} negative effect on the vertical movement of the western corn rootworm. Results show
that harmonic radar technology is a suitable method for studying the walking paths of the three insects
with appropriate tag type and size. The nuisance factor generated by appropriately sized tags was small
relative to that of vegetation.},

within an agricultural landscape. Until now, butterfly mobility has been predominantly studied using visual
observations and mark–recapture experiments. Attachment of a light-weight radar transponder to the
butterfly’s thorax did not significantly affect behaviour or mobility. Tracks were analysed for straightness,
duration, displacement, ground speed, foraging and the influence of linear landscape features on flight
direction. Two main styles of track were identified: (A) fast linear flight and (B) slower nonlinear flights
involving a period of foraging and/or looped sections of flight. These loops potentially perform an
orientation function, and were often associated with areas of forage. In the absence of forage, linear features
did not provide a guiding effect on flight direction, and only dense treelines were perceived as barriers. The
results provide tentative support for non-random dispersal and a perceptual range of 100–200 m for these
species. This study has demonstrated a methodology of significant value for future investigation of butterfly

The greater impact of the virus was attributed to its much higher power of dispersal through infected beetles.

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {The rhinoceros beetles Oryctes boas (F.) and O. monoceros (Oliv.) do serious damage to coconut palms in Zanzibar and East Africa. These beetles breed in decaying wood, particularly decaying palm trunks, and in manure and compost heaps. They lay their eggs in the decaying vegetable matter, often boring well inside to do so. The eggs, white and the size of mustard seeds, hatch in 7 to 9 days. The larvae take between one hundred and two hundred days to reach maturity according to temperature and availability of food; and the pupal stage lasts from 14 to 21 days. Damage is caused by the adult beetles since they bore into the growing tip of the palm: in some cases this kills the palm, particularly if it is a young one, but generally it causes a considerable reduction in leaf area and distortion of the palm. Mansfield-Aders (1920) reports that Oryctes spp. caused serious damage in Zanzibar and that no insect parasites had been found. During the nineteen thirties it was discovered that the scolliid wasp Scalia ruficornis F. was a parasite on the larvae of Oryctes spp. and was considered to exercise considerable control of Oryctes spp. in Zanzibar, although there were no data to support this. Surveys of the numbers of Oryctes larvae parasitized by S. ruficornis have only shown about 10 maximal parasitism and it is doubtful whether this would be sufficient to keep the beetle in check. Agriculture hygiene, such as burying all decaying logs and vegetation, has done a great deal to check the pest. Scolliid wasps have been collected in Zanzibar by several people and, in some cases, introduced with great success in other parts of the world. Recently Dr. Dun of Kew Guinea collected scolliids here and he informs me that these are now well established near Keravat, New Guinea. Although the scolliid wasp has been successful in controlling Oryctes in other countries where it has been introduced I did not feel satisfied that it was solely responsible for the high degree of natural control prevailing here in Zanzibar. In one coconut plantation the Department of Agriculture havc large compost heaps. These heaps breed numerous Oryctes spp. and counts on various occasions have indicated that under 10 \% of these are parasitized by S. rujlcornis. Since numerous pupae and freshly emerged adults of Oryctes spp. can generally be found in these heaps, it would be natural to expect a high rate of Oryctes damage in the surrounding coconut palms. In actual fact, there appears less Oryctes damage in this plantation than elsewhere, where there are no compost heaps breeding Oryctes. While examining the crowns of the palms in this area for Pseudotheraptus damage, I was astonished by the numbers of dead Oryctes adults that were present in the debris that collects in the axils of the leaves, and also very painfully made aware of the presence of the assassin bug Platymerus rhadamanthus Gerst. hiding in this debris. Most of the dead Oryctes spp. were merely hollow exoskeletons, and each one had a sizeable hole in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. In what appeared freshly killed specimens small ants such as Plagiolepis brunni Mayr, Crematogaster nr rectinota For., Semonius schultzei For., Cardiocondyla wroughtoni For. and Tapinoma luleus Em. were often observed cleaning the inside of the dead beetle through this hole. It seemed that there might be some connection between the assassin bug P. rhadamanthus and these dead Oryctes spp., so several living adult P. rhudamanthus were captured and male and female Oryctes sp. were offered for food. It was observed that P. rhadamanthus immediately seized and pierced Oryctes by inserting its proboscis in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. The beetles ceased to struggle after 15 to 20 seconds and the assassin bug spent two or three hours feeding on the dead Orytes. Examination of these dead Oryctes failed to show any obvious "hole" where P. rlwdamanthus had fed; the puncture was, no doubt, enlarged later by one of the ant species previously mentioned. Following the above observations further work was undertaken on P. rhadamanthus. During July 1957 Dr. P. Surany of the South Pacific High Commission visited Zanzibar and searched for the presence of fungous and virus diseases of Oryctes larvae. He is of the opinion that a large percentage of the Oryctes larvae are infected, and that virus and fungous diseases cause a high mortality amongst the larvae. Nevertheless, from an examination of compost heaps and rotting logs it was concluded that a considerable number of adults must l,ave emerged.},

fsheries. Here we describe the frst naturally-occurring virus reported in any clawed lobster species.
Hypertrophied nuclei with emarginated chromatin, characteristic histopathological lesions of {DNA}
virus infection, were observed within the hepatopancreatic epithelial cells of juvenile European lobsters
(Homarus gammarus). Transmission electron microscopy revealed infection with a bacilliform virus
containing a rod shaped nucleocapsid enveloped in an elliptical membrane. Assembly of {PCR}-free
shotgun metagenomic sequencing produced a circular genome of 107,063bp containing 97 open
reading frames, the majority of which share sequence similarity with a virus infecting the black tiger
shrimp: Penaeus monodon nudivirus ({PmNV}). Multiple phylogenetic analyses confrm the new virus to
be a novel member of the Nudiviridae: Homarus gammarus nudivirus ({HgNV}). Evidence of occlusion
body formation, characteristic of {PmNV} and its closest relatives, was not observed, questioning the
horizontal transmission strategy of {HgNV} outside of the host. We discuss the potential impacts of {HgNV}
on juvenile lobster growth and mortality and present {HgNV}-specifc primers to serve as a diagnostic tool

Understanding the dispersal characteristics of such 'beneficials' is of crucial importance for classical, augmentative, inundative and conservation biological control. It is a key practice, following the release of 'classical' (exotic) and augmentative (indigenous) biological control agents, to assess whether they have become successfully established, and also to what extent the agent has spread from the release points. It is important in conservation biological control to understand the role that natural enemy movements play in the improvement of pest control achieved through the provision of pollen, nectar, shelter and/or alternative prey/hosts. Other aspects of predator and parasitoid movement pertinent to biological control are the role refugia play in influencing, via natural enemy movements, control of pest population numbers. In these areas and others, some form of marking and/or tracking of insect predators and parasitoids is usually required so that movements can be studied. This special issue considers the usefulness and limitations of marking and tracking techniques, through up-to-date reviews written by an international team of researchers who are actively involved in the study of predator and parasitoid ecology.},

Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly devastating to island ecosystems, causing direct and indirect impacts through overgrazing, which often results in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Removing goat populations from islands is a powerful conservation tool to prevent extinctions and restore ecosystems. Goats have been eradicated successfully from 120 islands worldwide.With newly developed technology and techniques, island size is perhaps no longer a limiting factor in the successful removal of introduced goat populations. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, aerial hunting by helicopter, specialized hunting dogs, and Judas goats has dramatically increased efficiency and significantly reduced the duration of eradication campaigns. Intensive monitoring programs are also critical for successful eradications. Because of the presence of humans with domestic goat populations on large islands, future island conservation actions will require eradication programs that involve local island inhabitants in a collaborative approach with biologists, sociologists, and educators. Given the clear biodiversity benefits, introduced goat populations should be routinely removed from islands.},

	title = {A virus disease of the Indian rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (linnaeus), caused by a new type of insect virus, Rhabdionvirus oryctes gen. n., sp. n},
	volume = {8},
	abstract = {During investigations on the pathology of field populations of Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus) in Southeast Asia and in certain islands of the South Pacific, grubs suffering from a virus disease were detected in Malaya. Signs and symptoms of this so-called “Malaya disease” are described. In diseased larvae, the fat body is greatly disintegrated. Fat cells often show a striking proliferative response to virus infection. By differential centrifugation of suspensions of homogenized affected fat-body lobes, spherical viral particles with mostly polygonal contours and an average diameter of 164 ± 16 mμ could be isolated together with a comparatively low number of virus rods measuring about 200 × 70 mμ. These viral sediments proved highly infective for larvae when inoculated into the body cavity. The same was the case with filtrates of homogenized fat body of diseased larvae when filters with a mean pore size of 1 micron, 600 mμ, and 300 mμ were used. Injection of filtrates passed through 100-mμ-pore filters had no apparent effect on the larvae, yet the emerging adults were crippled.

Ultrathin sections revealed that the nuclei of fat-body cells are the principal sites of virus reproduction, yet repeatedly virogenic foci could also be observed in the cytoplasm. In an advanced stage of cell infection the hypertrophied nuclei contain crowds of singleor double-membraned spherical viral particles (shells), most of them ranging in diameter from 120 to 230 mμ (mean 160 mμ), and, closely associated with them, masses of virus rods with a length predominantly ranging from 170 to 210 mμ (mean 195 mμ) and an average width of 70 mμ. Both components are identical with the isolated spheres and rods. The virus rods, being the mature form of the virus, have a highly differentiated structure. They are established (1) from dense, chromatinlike virogenic stroma, (2) from loose, fibrillar and granular stromal material, (3) from filaments, and (4) from inside of the single- or double-membraned spherical particles (shells). Thus, the spheres represent viral developmental stages. The virus rods are not occluded in polyhedra or capsules of microcrystalline proteinaceous material. Yet clusters of rods may be densely packed in a two- or three-dimensional pseudocrystalline pattern.

The disease is easily transmissible to third-instar larvae by contaminated food as well as by intrahemocoelic inoculation. The period of lethal infection is from about 6 to 30 days. Peroral and intrahemocoelic transmission of the disease to larvae of Oryctes nasicornis (Linnaeus) also is easily effected.

The virus cannot be classed with any known group of insect viruses. Accordingly, it is placed in a new genus for which the generic name Rhabdionvirus gen.n. is proposed. The type species of this new genus (the virus under discussion) is named Rhabdionvirus oryctes gen. n., sp. n.},

When {HindlII} fragment D and {BamHI} fragment D were hybridized to Southern
transfers six regions containing reiterated sequences were found. The physical map for Oryctes baculovirus could not be orientated with respect to other published baculovirus maps because the {BamHI} fragment F of Autographa californiea nuclear polyhedrosis virus which contains conserved polyhedrin gene sequences common to occluded baculoviruses did not bind to Oryctes baculovirus {DNA}.},

When A. albopictus cells were inoculated with high concentrations of Oryctes baculovirus virus uptake and syncytia formation occurred but there was no evidence of virus replication and thus infection probably did not occur. It is suggested therefore that a previous report of replication of Oryctes baculovirus in both S. frugiperda and A. albopictus cells is incorrect and an alternative interpretation of this report is proposed.},

The aggregation pheromone ethyl 4-methyloctanoate is produced by males of O. rhinoceros (also by the similar pest O. monoceros in Africa), and is used in traps as an important component of Integrated Pest Management ({IPM}) and in ecological studies. In Malaysia, the incidence of endemic entomopathogens can be increased. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is available for use as a biopesticide against immature stages in breeding sites and may be distributed by adults. The molecular and ultrastructure of Oryctes Nudivirus ({OrNV}) has been extensively studied. It kills larvae and is disseminated by adults. New {PCR} techniques may enable reliable estimates of the quantity of virions in experimental dosages ingested and hence of the virulence of different isolates.

	abstract = {Hemolymph of healthy grubs of Oryctes rhinoceros possesses trehalose content of 380 ± 30 mg/dl that is five times higher than the content of glucose. Experimental stressors, either internal or external have resulted in the elevation of glucose through degradation of trehalose mediated by the elevated activity of trehalase; the hyperglycaemia was disproportionate with the decrease of trehalose content. Glycogen phosphorylase ({GP}), an important enzyme of the skeletal muscle of vertebrates was located in the cell free hemolymph of grubs, at an exponentially elevated level of 320 ± 20 µmols/min/mg protein. Both {GP} and Hexokinase showed a sharp reduction in activity under exposure to stressors. Accumulation of lactic acid along with an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed. Inhibition of {GP} activity by hyperglycaemia together with decline of hexokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, proves that the larvae might have adopted an energy conserving mechanism and thereby channelling glucose for the purpose of defense. Elevation of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase during stress may also help them to synthesis defensive chemicals like glutathione and polyols. Existence of such a wonderful biochemical mechanism helps them to thrive very well in cow dung pits a microenvironment possessing biotic and abiotic stressors, without undergoing diapause.},

The {RPW} is a palm borer insect that develops within the soft tissues of the trunk and crown, eventually leading to tree death. Early detection of {RPW} infestation is crucial because,at an early stage of infestation,palms can be treated more efﬁciently and saved,while the determination of treatment efﬁcacy is hugely vital to optimize palm rescue efforts. Detection is often particularly problematic since not all palms can be accessed and inspected directly. Thermography technique can determine the thermal properties of any objects of interest, and it is a non-destructive. In thermography, the invisible radiation patternsaretransformedtovisibleimagescalledthermalimages.Thosethermalimages are acquired using speciﬁc sensors that can be coupled with many available optical systems. Due to the simple operating procedure and the noticeable reductions in equipment cost of thermal imaging systems, it gains popularity in pests’ detection.

viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) and influenza virus but not small
non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus and poliovirus. To develop methods of
sterilization, confirmation of results using appropriate samples is necessary. Towards this
goal, several physical methods have recently been developed to facilitate sterilization;
including the use of pulsed light, supercritical fluids, pulsed electric fields, and gas
plasma. Although most of these methods have not been widely adopted, further increases
in reliability, convenience, and suitability should contribute to the spread of their

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L., 1758), is a large scarab beetle native to Southeast Asia and a major pest of coconut (Cocos nucifera) and oil (Elaeis guineensis) palms in its invaded range. Few tools are available for coconut rhinoceros beetle management, particularly for an emerging haplotype with resistance to known strains of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, the traditional biological control agent used in coconut rhinoceros beetle management programs. {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) represents an emerging tool for insect pest control that exploits an existing pathway for gene regulation in the target organism. In this study, we evaluated {RNAi} as a potential tool for coconut rhinoceros beetle management. Using transcriptome data generated from gut tissue of early instar larvae, we identified 24 {RNAi} target sequences that were either highly expressed or had demonstrated efficacy in other insect systems. Double-stranded (ds){RNAs} ranging from 249 to 297 bp in length were generated for 23 of these target sequences and 150 ng were microinjected into coconut rhinoceros beetle 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instar larvae and adults. Five of these {dsRNAs} that targeted genes putatively encoding V-type {ATPase}, polyadenylate binding protein, and three forms of actin induced 30.8–100\% mortality within 14 days post injection (dpi). Microinjection of 2nd instars with 10 and 100 ng of these same five {dsRNAs} induced 20–100\% and 80–100\% mortality at 7 and 14 dpi, respectively. These results indicate {RNAi} should be explored as a possible management option for coconut rhinoceros beetle. Coconut rhinoceros beetle may also represent a model species for using {RNAi} in the management of large invasive insect species.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Federal agencies in the United States, as well as state, tribal, and local governments, and private landowners are actively working to prevent the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive species. Where invasive species are present, they are working to eradicate or control populations. However, with increases in trade, travel, and transport and the aggressive nature of invasive species, existing efforts are falling short of what is needed to address the problem (Seebens et al. 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to consider new and innovative solutions that can provide more effective and efficient solutions (Conservation X Labs 2017). In late 2016, through Executive Order 13751, the federal government was called on to incorporate technological innovations and other emerging priorities into federal efforts to address invasive species (Executive Office of the President 2016). This Executive Order specifies coordination of such federal action through the National Invasive Species Council ({NISC}) and through {NISC} staff, as the operational component of the Council. Following on this, in 2017, the Entomological Society of America ({ESA}) announced its new Annals of the {ESA} (Hurd 2017). The new direction was taken to encourage articles that promote interdisciplinary dialogue and consider topics of importance to society. Then, in late 2018, the {ESA} focused its grand challenge agenda on ‘Addressing the North American and Pacific Rim Invasive Insect and Arthropod Species Challenge’ where the report from the workshop states:
Invasive Arthropod Alien Species ({IAAS}) are a known threat to our quality of life. They outcompete native species, help spread disease, and transform ecosystems. They travel over and through borders, mostly as undetected hitch-hikers in trade and human movement. As global traffic and trade continues to increase, the problem will only get worse.
The workshop report also called for continued innovation:
We need new technologies and approaches for risk assessment, pre-border and border detection, post-border monitoring, eradication (when feasible), and management of established pests. Existing technologies, meanwhile, can be used more effectively. The invention-to-implementation pipeline... needs to be diversified, strengthened, and ensured. These new tools should not only address capacity issues but also im
prove sustainability of our prevention and management approaches. (Hueppelsheuser et al. 2019)
With this grand challenge, the new direction of the {ESA} Annals, and the 2016 Executive Order, the {NISC} staff has partnered with {ESA} to generate a series of scientific articles related to emerging technologies at the nexus of insects and invasive species. The response has been substantial enough to warrant two special issues: one on the use of geospatial techniques and one pertaining to genetics. Here, we provide a brief description of the nine articles contained in this special issue focusing on advanced genetic tools and technology. General information for the nine articles in this special issue is provided in Table 1. In addition to the author and title, we list the species considered, the theme of the article, and the specifics of the genetics analysis.

Biodiversitas 21: 2047-2055. Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}) is known as a successful classical biological control agent. Recent reports have revealed differences in pathogenicity among {OrNV} isolates, with correlation suspected between virus virulence and genetic variability. The aim of the research is to study the genetic variability of {OrNV} isolates based on the {DNA} polymerase ({DNA} pol) gene and their phylogenetic relationship with Genus Alphanudivirus. Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) as an {OrNV} host were collected from Sumatra, Belitung, Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi. Primers were designed to amplify complete gene of {DNA} pol. Sequencing, phylogenetic, and investigate genetic diversity scores were used to determine variability at nucleotide level. Five primers successfully amplified the entire {DNA} pol gene. Genetic variability of {OrNV} was high, from nine isolates found eight genetically different. Isolates could be divided into two groups of genetic diversity: high and low. High genetic diversity of {OrNV} supposed as an old population that occupied Sundaland and Wallacean paleogeography at first appearance in Miocene Era until early Pliocene 5 Mya. New population of {OrNV} had low genetic diversity were travel cross-island that supposed to correlate with oil palm plantation development and the genetic drift. The benefit information of the {OrNV} genetic variability is as preliminary guideline for virulence test. {OrNV} is a member of Nudiviridae family, Genus Alphanudivirus, and at recent moment they consist of eight species. Alphanudivirus infect Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Orthoptera order that soil as immature niche may explain their closely related taxa.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Oryctes genus consists of 42 species known across the world, which are major palm tree pests. Oryctes rhinoceros is one of the most harmful pests for the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) and the African oil palm (Elais guineensis) in the south and southeast of Asia and Western Pacific islands, although it may attack other ornamental palm trees. The present paper documents the first record of the interception of O. rhinoceros (coconut rhinoceros beetle) at the Manzanillo harbor in Colima - one of the main entry points of imported goods. A single specimen of the insect of interest was collected: a living adult present in a shipment of palm tree furniture from Indonesia, whose final destination was the state of Jalisco. The entomological sample was sent to the Laboratorio de Análisis y Referencia en Sanidad Forestal of the Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Semarnat for its identification. Phytosanitary measures were subsequently implemented in order to prevent the entry of this beetle, an exotic pest, into the country. Furthermore, the document expounds certain considerations regarding the potential economic implications for Mexico of the introduction of O. rhinoceros into the national territory and its development herein.

	volume = {20:957},
	abstract = {Background: The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, is a major pest of palm crops in tropical Asia and the Pacific Islands. Little molecular data exists for this pest, impeding our ability to develop effective countermeasures and deal with the species’ growing resistance to viral biocontrols. We present the first molecular biology analyses of this species, including a metagenomic assay to understand the microbiome of different sections of its digestive tract, and a transcriptomics assay to complement the microbiome data and to shed light on genes of interest like plant cell wall degrading enzymes and immunity and xenobiotic resistance genes. Results: The gut microbiota of Oryctes rhinoceros larvae is quite similar to that of the termite gut, as both species feed on decaying wood. We found the first evidence for endogenous beta-1,4-endoglucanase in the beetle, plus evidence for microbial cellobiase, suggesting the beetle can degrade cellulose together with its gut microfauna. A number of antimicrobial peptides are expressed, particularly by the fat body but also by the midgut and hindgut. Conclusions: This transcriptome provides a wealth of data about the species’ defense against chemical and biological threats, has uncovered several potentially new species of microbial symbionts, and significantly expands our knowledge about this pest.

A novel virus pathogenic to the beetle, originally designated as Rhabdionvirus oryctes and later Oryctes virus, was isolated from Malaysia and introduced into Samoa in 1963. Later releases took place in Tonga, Fiji and other Paciﬁc Islands. The virus rapidly established and caused high levels of infection that spread as epizootics through the beetle populations. The virus killed larvae in breeding sites and caused adult beetles to cease feeding, leading to reduced damage and a decline in fecundity of the pest population. Researchers reported spectacular declines in the treated populations within 1–3 years of application. Reapplication has proven effective where there has been a resurgence of beetle damage. After 40 years from the initial releases, high palm damage has been reported from some areas suggesting a breakdown of control. Selection of more virulent strains and improved methods of application could overcome these problems.},

Pest populations were monitored by palm damage surveys for up to 4 yr on 22 islands, some of them deliberately untreated. The method used allowed estimates from a single survey of the number of beetle attacks during each of 18 mo (3rd–20th month before the survey date). Such surveys gave continuous records for O. rhinoceros attacks during 1983–1987. Most islands where the virus was released showed a highly significant reduction in palm damage. The prerelease pest density on a given island influenced the efficacy of the virus introduction. Adjustments were made for this effect when the performances of the different virus strains were compared. Strain X2B gave consistently better reduction in pest populations and more virus-infected beetles compared with strain V2/3B; the remaining strains gave intermediate control. These results agreed with earlier laboratory tests, in which the virulence of both strains was compared by infecting O. rhinoceros larvae. Two islands where three strains were released simultaneously also experienced a high damage reduction; here, X2B predominated eventually over strains V2/3B and S2A.},

The results and those of previous surveys showed that the baculovirus disease usually has little influence on the overall survival rate of O. rhinoceros larvae, but that it reduces dramatically the average life span of the adult beetles. This and the ability of the virus disease to persist at low host densities are the main reasons for its success as a microbial control agent. The data provide additional evidence that the presence of a low number of dead standing palms per hectare promotes the spread of the virus disease because these are highly attractive to adult beetles. It is concluded from the results that in areas where the baculovirus is indigenous, control methods should be directed against the larval population of O. rhinoceros.},

The signs of infection in cells by all types of {OrNV} were clearly seen at 10 to 14 days after treatment ({DAT}). The infected cells experienced cytopathic effects ({CPE}) involving formation of high number of vesicle or globule like-structures around the cells. The density of viable cells in flasks inoculated by the nudivirus decreased over time. At 16 {DAT}, the viable cell density in flasks inoculated with {OrNV} types A, B, and C was 1.49 × 105, 0.29 × 105, and 4.78 × 105 cells ml-1 respectively, significantly lower (P{\textless}0.05) compared to control flask of 7.98 × 105 cells ml-1. Based on the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50\% ({TCID}50), it was found that the {OrNV} type B was more virulent than the {OrNV} types A and C as it produced high infectious virus particles. The {TCID}50 values for the {OrNV} types A and C were 3.00 × 107 infectious unit ({IU} ml-1) and 8.03 x 105 {IU} ml-1 as compared to type B which was 7.09 × 107 {IU} ml-1. The {PCR} analysis showed that all types of {OrNV} had successfully replicated in the cells as early as 4 {DAT}.

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Abstract The infestation levels of O. rhinoceros were investigated in the oil palm trunk heaps in three replanting blocks (Blocks A, B and C) at Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. These blocks had different densities of pheromone trapping: high (11 traps per ha, Block B), normal (1 trap per 2 ha, Block C), while no pheromone trapping was conducted in (Block A. Without pheromone trapping, the infestation levels of O. rhinoceros can reach a maximum density of between 25 to 50 individuals per m2 ({IPMS}). The O. rhinoceros population was still detected in the heaps up to more than two years (at 26 months after replanting). With high density trapping, infestation levels were maintained below 10 {IPMS} and was not detected in the heaps after a period of 16 months of replanting. In the normal trapping density, the population was also maintained below 10 {IPMS} but had sustained itself in the heaps for up to 24 months. The mortality factors associated with the larval stages sampled within these replanting blocks was determined by visual symptoms with subsequent verification with microbial analysis. The analysis was narrowed down to detect only bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis and B. popillae), virus (Oryctes virus) and fungus (Metarhizium). In Block A, the population of O. rhinoceros in the trunks was reduced drastically at 14 months after replanting ({MAR}), which could be due to the high mortality (88\%) of the third instar larvae, 3 months earlier. In Block B, the percentage mortality for the larval stage was always highest at the third instars (between 21-82\%). In Block C however, the mortality of the third instars was low, never exceeding 35\%. In these sampling blocks, the infection of Metarhizium seem to be less dominant compared to virus or bacteria The k factor analysis indicates density dependence among the third instar larvae had contributed to the change in its population density in Block A. Therefore, with proper manipulation of pheromone traps and targeted application of disease agents (i.e virus,fungus and bacteria), the population of O. rhinoceros can be managed more effectively in an oil palm replanting.},

	abstract = {Optimization of the polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) method for the rapid detection of Oryctes rhinoceros virus ({OrV}) was studied. The virus {DNA} was extracted from the gut tissues by a robust method. Using a pair of specific primers, Primer 15a and 15b, infection was confirmed when the {PCR} product produced a single 945 bp {DNA} band.  The optimized concentrations of the {PCR} components were at 2.0 {mM} {MgCl}2, 1.0 {mM} 10X {PCR} buffer, 0.2 {mM} Primer 15a and 15b, 0.5 U Taq-{DNA} polymerase and 0.4 mg bovine serum albumin ({BSA}).  All tested virus {DNA} concentrations at 0.085, 0.170 and 0.255 μg μl-1 were suitable for virus detection.  Addition of {BSA} (20 mg ml-1) at 0.4 mg in the reaction increased the {PCR} sensitivity. The method is capable of detecting {OrV} infection from {DNA} diluted one million times or equivalent to a virus {DNA} concentration as low as 2.23 pg μl-1. The {PCR} detected 83.2\% adult beetles from pheromone traps as being infected by {OrV}, 13.6\% higher (P{\textless}0.05) than the results based on observations on the gut morphological appearance (69.6\%). A typical {OrV} infection symptom is a swollen gut filled with milky fluid.  Of the 839 guts with this symptom, 97.6\% were diagnosed to be infected which was not significantly different (P{\textgreater}0.05) compared to the method based on gut morphological appearance. The {PCR} was also capable in detecting virus at an early infection stage and in dead adults with decayed tissues. Of the 307 adults that appeared to be healthy, 36.1\% of them were found to be infected.  As much as 61.6\% of dead adults with decayed tissues (N = 428) were diagnosed to be infected by the {OrV}.  The method can be used in further research studies relating to {OrV} for the management of the rhinoceros beetle.

	abstract = {In view of the increasing and devastating damage by rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) to coconut palms in the middle of last century, many efforts were made to find an efficient natural control factor against this pest, which could not be controlled by pesticides. The basic procedures of these monitoring programmes are outlined together with the final detection of a virus disease in oil palm estates in Malaysia in 1963. In extensive laboratory studies, the virus was isolated and identified as the first non-occluded, rod-shaped insect virus, morphologically resembling the baculoviruses. Infection experiments clarified the pathology, histopathology, and virulence of the virus and demonstrated that the virus was extremely virulent to larvae after peroral application. These findings encouraged the first pilot release of virus in 1967 in coconut plantations of Western Samoa where breeding sites were contaminated with virus. Surprisingly, the virus became established in the Samoan rhinoceros beetle populations and spread autonomously throughout the Western Samoan islands. As a consequence, there was a drastic decline of the beetle populations followed by a conspicuous recovery of the badly damaged coconut stands. This unexpected phenomenon could only be explained after it was shown that the adult beetle itself is a very active virus vector and thus was responsible for the efficient autodissemination of the virus. The functioning of the beetle as a 'flying virus factory' is due to the unique cytopathic process developing in the midgut after peroral virus infection. Pathological details of this process are presented. Because of the long-term persistence of the virus in the populations, rhinoceros beetle control is maintained. Incorporation of virus into integrated control measures and successful virus releases in many other countries are recorded. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {9},
	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}), Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), has become one of the most important coconut and oil palm pests. This species was detected attacking coconut palms on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi in December 2013, and an eradication program was initiated. One of the major challenges for eradication has been the identification of new breeding sites. Information on the factors influencing oviposition is needed to aid in finding sites likely to host the immature stages of this insect. In this study, a series of choice tests were conducted to assess the oviposition preferences of both laboratory-reared and wild-caught {CRB}. Mated females, of both lab-reared and wild-caught beetles, were offered for oviposition a choice between sand and two mulch substrates, one with small and one with large particle sizes. Both types of {CRB} laid eggs preferentially in substrate of small particle size rather than large and none laid eggs in sand. Labreared and wild-caught {CRB} differed in their oviposition behavior and size. These results can be used to aid in the identification of breeding sites for management programs and eradication efforts.},

	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) is a severe pest of coconut and other palms that has invaded the South Pacific in the last decade. The beetle can cause great economic losses, not only to agriculture but also due to indirect impacts on tropical aesthetics and tourism. In the last decade, new invasive populations of the beetle have been detected on Guam and Oahu, Hawaii. Despite the beetle’s extensive invasion history and economic impacts, little is known about its invasion dynamics. We used 1,480 base pairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial and 814 base pairs of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase nuclear {DNA} to conduct a population genetics analysis on eight beetle populations from Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China in the beetle’s native range and Palau, American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii in the beetle’s invasive range, in an attempt to resolve invasion pathways. Genetic diversity was insufficient to generate strong evidence for O. rhinoceros movement patterns. Mitochondrial {DNA} provided a clear but poorly supported population structure. Although nuclear {DNA} proved to be more diverse, population structure lacked clear signal. This lack of diversity is congruent with a rapid, recent invasion. There appears to be no genetic exchange between populations once they establish, implying that they are rare, human-mediated dispersal events.},

No virus infections occurred in larvae hatching from eggs surface-contaminated with the virus. Larvae hatching from eggs laid by virus-infected females very rarely were infected.

In the O. rhinoceros population the virus is transmitted most frequently during mating, possibly when the uninfected partner contacts virus material excreted by the infected partner. The virus can be transmitted in a similar way when infected and healthy beetles feed together in palm trees. Beetles visiting larval breeding sites containing freshly virus-killed larvae can become infected. Virus-infected beetles can pass the infection to healthy larvae when visiting a breeding site.},

Two cloned {PstI} fragments, C and D, of {OrV} {DNA} have been sequenced, consisting of 19,805 and 17,146bp, respectively, and comprising about 30\% of the {OrV} genome. For each of the two fragments, 20 open reading frames ({ORFs}) of 150 nucleotides or greater with no or minimal overlap were predicted. Ten of the predicted 40 {ORFs} revealed signiﬁcant similarities to Heliothis zea virus 1 ({HzV}-1) {ORFs}, of which ﬁve, lef-4, lef-5, pif-2, dnapol and ac81, are homologues of conserved core genes in the family Baculoviridae, and one is homologous to baculovirus rr1. A baculovirus odv-e66 homologue is also present in {OrV}. Five {ORFs} encode proteins
homologous to cellular thymidylate synthase ({TS}), patatin-like phospholipase, mitochondrial carrier protein, Ser=Thr protein phosphatase, and serine protease, respectively. {TS} is phylogenetically related to those of eukarya and nucleo-cytoplasmic large {dsDNA} viruses. However, the remaining 25 {ORFs} have poor or no sequence matches with the current databases. Both the gene content of the sequenced fragments and the phylogenetic analyses of the viral {DNA} polymerase suggest that {OrV} is most closely related to {HzV}-1. These ﬁndings and the re-evaluation of the relationship of {HzV}-1 to baculoviruses suggest that a new virus genus, Nudivirus, should be established, containing {OrV} and {HzV}-1, which are genetically related to members of the family Baculoviridae.},

The percentage of baculovirus-infected breeding sites increased with density of dead standing palms up to about five dead palms per hectare, but then decreased again. Larva mortality was higher in dead standing palms and stumps than in trunks on the ground. Rainfall was also a significant mortality factor. Palm damage due to O. rhinoceros increased with density of stumps and trunks on the ground but not with density of dead standing palms. It is concluded that in the Philippines dead standing palms can play an important role in spread of baculovirus and regulation of O. rhinoceros populations.},

Despite the elaborate literature on mechanisms, robust data on costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones are scant. Existing literature indicates that, in contrast to the diversity of mechanisms, the ecological conditions in which aggregation pheromones are used are more alike. This points to a few general categories for costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones, and these are discussed. We subsequently review interspecific interactions that may be affected by the use of aggregation pheromones. We encounter a strikingly frequent association of aggregation pheromones with fungi and microorganisms and address cross-attraction by competitor species and exploitation by natural enemies. We show that aggregative behavior by individuals through the use of pheromones can profoundly affect ecological interactions and advocate further evolutionary and ecological investigations of pheromone-mediated aggregation.},

Based on initial delimiting surveys it was determined that it had likely been there for at least two generations before it was detected and that consequently eradication was not an option. Soon after, scientists at {AgResearch}, New Zealand, confirmed it was the 'G' (Guam) strain of the species that is not susceptible to the nudivirus that controls another strain of {CRB} elsewhere in the South Pacific. An emergency response plan was developed but due to inadequate financing implementation has been inconsistent and weak, consequently it has spread and is now reported on parts of seven islands. More recently some funding has become available and a three-pronged management approach is being implemented: sanitation to reduce populations by destroying breeding sites (rotting palm logs, green manure, compost and chicken manure), restricting spread through internal quarantines on shipping and biological control by identifying effective entomopathogens for the long term. Work to identify strains of Oryctes Nudivirus ({OrNV}) effective against {CRB}-G is reported elsewhere in this symposium. Some preliminary details of work to introduce the green muscardine fungus, Metarhyzium anisopleae, are reported here.},

	abstract = {Rapid and reliable identiﬁcation of insects is important in many contexts, from the detection of disease vectors and invasive species to the sorting of material from biodiversity inventories. Because of the shortage of adequate expertise, there has long been an interest in developing automated systems for this task. Previous attempts have been based on laborious and complex handcrafted extraction of image features, but in recent years it has been shown that sophisticated convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) can learn to extract relevant features automatically, without human intervention. Unfortunately, reaching expert-level accuracy in {CNN} identiﬁcations requires substantial computational power and huge training data sets, which are often not available for taxonomic tasks. This can be addressed using feature transfer: a {CNN} that has been pretrained on a generic image classiﬁcation task is exposed to the taxonomic images of interest, and information about its perception of those images is used in training a simpler, dedicated identiﬁcation system. Here, we develop an effective method of {CNN} feature transfer, which achieves expert-level accuracy in taxonomic identiﬁcation of insects with training sets of 100 images or less per category, depending on the nature of data set. Speciﬁcally, we extract rich representations of intermediate to high-level image features from the {CNN} architecture {VGG}16 pretrained on the {ImageNet} data set. This information is submitted to a linear support vector machine classiﬁer, which is trained on the target problem. We tested the performance of our approach on two types of challenging taxonomic tasks: 1) identifying insects to higher groups when they are likely to belong to subgroups that have not been seen previously and 2) identifying visually similar species that are difﬁcult to separate even for experts. For the ﬁrst task, our approach reached {\textgreater}92\% accuracy on one data set (884 face images of 11 families of Diptera, all specimens representing unique species), and {\textgreater}96\% accuracy on another (2936 dorsal habitus images of 14 families of Coleoptera, over 90\% of specimens belonging to unique species). For the second task, our approach outperformed a leading taxonomic expert on one data set (339 images of three species of the Coleoptera genus Oxythyrea; 97\% accuracy), and both humans and traditional automated identiﬁcation systems on another data set (3845 images of nine species of Plecoptera larvae; 98.6 \% accuracy). Reanalyzing several biological image identiﬁcation tasks studied in the recent literature, we show that our approach is broadly applicable and provides signiﬁcant improvements over previous methods, whether based on dedicated {CNNs}, {CNN} feature transfer, or more traditional techniques. Thus, our method, which is easy to apply, can be highly successful in developing automated taxonomic identiﬁcation systems even when training data sets are small and computational budgets limited. We conclude by brieﬂy discussing some promising {CNNbased} research directions in morphological systematics opened up by the success of these techniques in providing accurate diagnostic tools.},

	abstract = {Lignocellulose is very potential as raw material for biofuel production because it is cheap, abundant and renewable. The main carbohydrate constituents of lignocellulosic material are cellulose and hemicelluloses (a group of heteropolymers that includes xylans and mannans). The most important process in bioethanol production from lignocellulose is the bioconversion of polysaccharides into fermentable sugar. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been developed because it is the more environmentally approach. Since the cost of hydrolytic enzyme production is the major problem of the process, many type of research has been focused on lowering the cost of enzyme production, including screening for organisms with a novel enzyme. This present study was conducted to isolate and screen of the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic Bacteria from the gut of Oryctes rhinoceros L. larvae. The 3rd instars were used in this research. The research succeeded to isolate 11 bacterial isolates from the gut of O. rhinoceros larvae. The screening result demonstrated that bacterial isolates had cellulolytic (63.6\% of total isolates), xylanolytic (72.7\% of total isolates), and mannanolytic (100\% of total isolates) activity. Based on the 16S {rDNA} sequence, 10 isolates were classified into Bacillus and only 1 isolate was classified into Citrobacter. The {GOR}2 which was closely related to Bacillus pumilus vit bac1 has the highest cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities. The isolate with the highest mannanolytic activity was the {GOR}7 which was closely related to Bacillus aryabhattai strain {IHB} B 6821.},

	abstract = {Pathogens may gain a fitness advantage through manipulation of the behaviour of their hosts. Likewise, host behavioural
changes can be a defence mechanism, counteracting the impact of pathogens on host fitness. We apply harmonic radar
technology to characterize the impact of an emerging pathogen - Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) - on honeybee (Apis
mellifera) flight and orientation performance in the field. Honeybees are the most important commercial pollinators.
Emerging diseases have been proposed to play a prominent role in colony decline, partly through sub-lethal behavioural
manipulation of their hosts. We found that homing success was significantly reduced in diseased (65.8\%) versus healthy
foragers (92.5\%). Although lost bees had significantly reduced continuous flight times and prolonged resting times, other
flight characteristics and navigational abilities showed no significant difference between infected and non-infected bees.
Our results suggest that infected bees express normal flight characteristics but are constrained in their homing ability,
potentially compromising the colony by reducing its resource inputs, but also counteracting the intra-colony spread of infection. We provide the first high-resolution analysis of sub-lethal effects of an emerging disease on insect flight behaviour. The potential causes and the implications for both host and parasite are discussed.},

Current trends of application of {DNA} marker techniques in diverse domains of insect ecological studies show that mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA}), microsatellites, random amplified polymorphic {DNA} ({RAPD}), expressed sequence tags ({EST}) and amplified fragment length polymorphism ({AFLP}) markers have contributed significantly for progresses towards understanding genetic basis of insect diversity and for mapping medically and agriculturally important genes and quantitative trait loci in insect pests. Apart from these popular marker systems, other novel approaches including transposon display, sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (S-{SAP}), repeat-associated polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) markers have been identified as alternate marker systems in insect studies. Besides, whole genome microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) assays are becoming more popular to screen genome-wide polymorphisms in fast and cost effective manner. However, use of such methodologies has not gained widespread popularity in entomological studies. The current study highlights the recent trends of applications of molecular markers in insect studies and explores the technological advancements in molecular marker tools and modern high throughput genotyping methodologies that may be applied in entomological researches for better understanding of insect ecology at molecular level.},

These two enzymes are not measurable in the non-feeding prepupa and pupa and reappear in the adult with commencement of feeding. Secretion of digestive enzymes is correlated
with feeding.},

	abstract = {The Korean insect industry is rapidly developing, with the Korean horn beetle Allomyrina dichotoma as one of the most popular insects kept as pets. Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}). In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77\% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the {OrNV} disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on‐site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop‐mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP}) assay was thus tested. To avoid the {DNA} extraction process, the {LAMP} assay used a 50‐fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on‐site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the {OrNV} infectivity with {LAMP} primers targeting the {OrNV}\_gp102 gene. To evaluate the {LAMP} specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens, causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with {OrNV}. The positive results were detected only from the {OrNV}‐infected larvae.},

	shorttitle = {The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera},
	abstract = {Background
The coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}, Oryctes rhinoceros ) is a severe and invasive pest of coconut and other palms throughout Asia and the Pacific. The biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}), has successfully suppressed O. rhinoceros populations for decades but new {CRB} invasions started appearing after 2007. A single-{SNP} variant within the mitochondrial cox1 gene is used to distinguish the recently-invading {CRB}-G lineage from other haplotypes, but the lack of mitogenome sequence for this species hinders further development of a molecular toolset for biosecurity and management programmes against {CRB}. Here we report the complete circular sequence and annotation for {CRB} mitogenome, generated to support such efforts.

Methods
Sequencing data were generated using long-read Nanopore technology from genomic {DNA} isolated from a {CRB}-G female. The mitogenome was assembled with Flye v.2.5, using the short-read Illumina sequences to remove homopolymers with Pilon, and annotated with {MITOS}. Independently-generated transcriptome data were used to assess the O. rhinoceros mitogenome annotation and transcription. The aligned sequences of 13 protein-coding genes ({PCGs}) (with degenerate third codon position) from O. rhinoceros , 13 other Scarabaeidae taxa and two outgroup taxa were used for the phylogenetic reconstruction with the Maximum likelihood ({ML}) approach in {IQ}-{TREE} and Bayesian ({BI}) approach in {MrBayes}.

Results
The complete circular mitogenome of O. rhinoceros is 20,898 bp in length, with a gene content canonical for insects (13 {PCGs}, two {rRNA} genes, and 22 {tRNA} genes), as well as one structural variation (rearrangement of {trnQ} and {trnI} ) and a long control region (6,204 bp). Transcription was detected across all 37 genes, and interestingly, within three domains in the control region. {ML} and {BI} phylogenies had the same topology, correctly grouping O. rhinoceros with one other Dynastinae taxon, and recovering the previously reported relationship among lineages in the Scarabaeidae. In silico {PCR}-{RFLP} analysis recovered the correct fragment set that is diagnostic for the {CRB}-G haplogroup. These results validate the high-quality of the O. rhinoceros mitogenome sequence and annotation.},

Thirty-five percent of images showed palms with medium or high levels of damage. Damage was mapped using {GPS} tags and Picasa 3 software. Analysis showed that evidence of damage was distributed throughout the island, but medium and high damage occurred principally in zones in the North, South West and South of the island. The survey provided a baseline for the level of damage on Taveuni to identify areas to focus remediation activities and monitor changes to protect emerging coconut industries.},

Eggs and larvae were highly susceptible to radiation at all tested doses (down to about 2–5 Gy), though adults required larger doses (at least 50 Gy) to render them incapable of reproducing. At exposures near 50 Gy sterilized adults nevertheless were observed to survive for more than a month, suggesting {SIT} may be a viable control approach for this beetle. Similarly, these results may facilitate the discovery of hidden breeding sites in the wild by tagging and releasing sterilized adults. While larvae were highly susceptible to x-ray irradiation, irradiation would probably not be an effective tool for field control due to rapid attenuation of radiation energy (exponential decay coefficients ranging from about 0.3–0.6 cm−1) in the organic nesting materials we tested, and the tendency for {CRB} adults to burrow and oviposit deep in mulch (1 m or more).},

The results and those of previous surveys showed that the baculovirus disease usually has little influence on the overall survival rate of 0. rhinoceros larvae, but that it reduces dramatically the average life span of the adult beetles. This and the ability of the virus disease to persist at low host densities are the main reasons for its success as a microbial control agent. The data provide additional evidence that the presence of a low number of dead standing palms per hectare promotes the spread of the virus disease because these are highly attractive to adult beetles. It is concluded from the results that in areas 
where the baculovirus is indigenous, control methods 
should be directed against the larval population of 0. rhinoceros.},

populations of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) in the Maldives, either singly or in combination. Pest
populations were monitored by palm damage surveys for up to 4 yr on 22 islands, some of
them deliberately untreated. The method used allowed estimates from a single survey of the
number of beetle attacks during each of 18 mo (3rd-20th month before the survey date).
Such surveys gave continuous records for O. rhinoceros attacks during 1983-1987. Most
islands where the virus was released showed a highly significant reduction in palm damage.
The prerelease pest density on a given island influenced the efficacy of the virus introduction.
Adjustments were made for this effect when the performances of the different virus strains
were compared. Strain X2B gave consistently better reduction in pest populations and more
virus-infected beetles compared with strain V2/3B; the remaining strains gave intermediate
control. These results agreed with earlier laboratory tests, in which the virulence of both
strains was compared by infecting O. rhinoceros larvae. Two islands where three strains
were released Simultaneously also experienced a high damage reduction; here, X2B predom inated eventually over strains V2/3B and S2A.},

2. Coconut cap traps baited with ethylchrysanthemumate attracted

identified influencing catches but trapping was found to be unsuitable for 
accurately assessing pest populations. 
3. A new method which gives estimates on the monthly number of 
0.rhinoceros attacks on coconut palms, was tested in the Maldives. Palms 
are climbed about once a year and the sequence of fronds, the number and 
the position of beetle cuts are recorded. 
4. Reduction with age of the length of three teeth on the fore tibia of 
0.rhinoceros adults was studied in the Philippines. The data was insuffi cient to obtain a clear correlation between age and length of teeth. 
5. The observations indicated that in the Philippines after leaving their 
site of pupation, 0.rhinoceros adults spend about 5 weeks feeding on 
coconut palms. This is followed by a period of about 7 weeks in breeding 
sitesand,on occasion, additional visits to palms. With these estimates it was

	abstract = {Recently, incursions of the Coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}), Oryctes rhinoceros, have been detected in south Pacific countries that were previously free of the pest. It has been suggested that this range expansion is related to an O. rhinoceros haplotype that is reported to show reduced susceptibility to the well-established classical biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}). We investigated O. rhinoceros population genetics and the {OrNV} status of specimens collected in Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea ({PNG}), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and the Philippines. Based on the sequence of the mitochondrial {CoxI} gene, we found three major mitochondrial haplotype groups ({CRB}-G, {CRB}-{PNG} and {CRB}-S) across the region. Haplotype diversity varied between and within countries and a high incidence of {OrNV} infection was detected in all haplotypes wherever they occurred. The O. rhinoceros population in some countries was monotypic and all individuals tested belonged to a single haplotype group. However, in Samoa we detected {CRB}-S and {CRB}-{PNG} and in Solomon Islands we detected all three haplotype groups. Genotyping-by-Sequencing ({GBS}) showed genetic differentiation in the O. rhinoceros nuclear genome across populations on different islands and provided evidence for gene flow, resulting in a well-mixed population, despite the presence of different {CoxI} haplotypes in Solomon Islands. Evidence of admixture was also detected on both islands of Samoa. The current {CoxI} based method is not a reliable diagnostic marker for phenotypic traits, especially in countries such as Solomon Islands where the mitochondrial haplotypes have come back into sympatry and are mixed. To identify possible mechanisms of resistance to {OrNV}, further molecular analyses O. rhinoceros in response to virus infection is required. To improve biological control of O. rhinoceros, such analyses will need to be combined with an improved understanding of the population genetics of the pest and the evolutionary history of {OrNV} in the region.},

	abstract = {Hawaii and the {US}-affliated Pacifc Islands (see Figs. A2.1
and A2.2 for associated map) have high levels of endemic
native biodiversity, largely as a function of varied ecosystems
and isolation. For example, Hawaii is the most isolated
archipelago on Earth where 90\% of its 10,000 native species
are endemic. This geographic area represents most major
forest ecosystem types and includes thousands of oceanic
islands, elevational clines from coastal to alpine in temperate
and tropical ecosystems, species and communities that occur
nowhere else in the world, the tallest mountains on Earth,
and a broad range of governments and cultures.
Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable and
susceptible to environmental change from both natural disturbances (wildfire, food, hurricane, typhoon,  nd drought) and anthropogenic disturbances (invasive species,
deforestation, pollution, and urbanization). Climate change is further exacerbating existing ecological challenges and affecting biological diversity across all biological scales in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This is a global challenge faced around the world, but it is particularly acute in Hawaii and the {US}-affliated Pacifc Islands, where the loss of biodiversity from extirpations and extinctions is already
consequential. An estimated 270 plant and animal species have gone extinct over the past 200 years in Hawaii, with an additional 440 species threatened or endangered (Wagner et al. 1999).
Despite the recognized prominence of invasive species in most of the terrestrial ecosystems in Hawaii and the {US}-affliated Pacifc Islands, it is unclear if this is a result of more invasive species being introduced or if human disturbance allows greater establishment. In general, Hawaii is considered ground zero for invasive species (Dawson et al. 2017), and with many other ecosystems likely to be impacted, Hawaii can serve as a model system through innovative approaches to both reduce the impacts of invasive species and enhance the resilience of native species assemblages.},

Although our study did not show significant effects of Heterorhabditis spp. strains against {CRB} larvae, some strains inflicted mortality of first instar larvae after 2 days as well as a week after exposure. Our findings indicated that the locally available strains of eterorhabditis spp. could potentially be a useful biological control agent, in an {IPM} program, to control first instar {CRB} larvae. However, further research is needed to test virulent commercial strains of Heterorhabditid and Steinernematid against {CRB} larvae.

	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}: Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus) is one of the most damaging pests to coconut and oil palms in Asia and the Pacific Islands. Adults bore into the crown and damage developing fronds, which affects tree development and yield. The insect is native to South and Southeast Asia and was inadvertently introduced into the Pacific in 1909. It has since spread to several Pacific island nations and territories , causing significant economic impact on these important coconut and palm-growing regions. In the 1950s and 1960s, an international biological control effort was initiated to search for and release natural enemy species. Release of the Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus Huger ({OrNV}) and the species complex of Metarhizium Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) was successful in controlling {CRB} in its invaded range. Recently a new biotype of the beetle, known as {CRB}-G, has spread into the Pacific Islands causing unprecedented levels of damage due to the failure of previously successful biological control agents ({BCAs}) to suppress this biotype. The re-emergence of {CRB} as a serious pest warrants a rigorous re-evaluation of potential {BCAs} and a new search for effective natural enemies if necessary. In this article, we review literature on {CRB} to 1) analyze past introductions of {BCAs} and their effectiveness; 2) identify potentially important natural enemies and their geographical origins; and 3) assess possible approaches for utilization of {BCAs} against the new wave of {CRB} invasion. Research gaps and directions deserving future attention are highlighted and a strategy for renovation of biological controls for {CRB} suggested.},

	abstract = {{COGEM} advices the Dutch Government on the required containment measures for activities involving genetically modified organisms ({GMOs}). To do so properly, it first has to be determined if an organism is pathogenic, and if so to what extent. In recent years the number of species of (micro) organisms that are being investigated in research laboratories has increased greatly. As a result, the number of applications for pathogenicity classifications has been very high in the recent years.Due to the increase in research involving insect viruses, it is expected that {COGEM} will increasingly be asked for advice on the pathogenicity classification of insect viruses for experiments with {GMOs}. Therefore {COGEM} commissioned a research project in order to examine whether it is possible to generically classify insect-specific viruses.The project was carried out by professor Just Vlak (Viro-Logica). Based on review of scientific literature and the current taxonomy of viruses as determined by the ‘International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses’ ({ICTV}) the researcher has determined which of the 34 investigated taxa are insect-specific. In the research report a further examination is made of the characteristics and biology of insect-specific viruses including their pathogenicity. The report also includes an overview table in which the most frequently used insects in production systems have been listed and their associated putative insect-specific viruses are indicated.},

food. These enzymes can be produced by the insect, or by microbes living in the wood and/or
inside the insect gut. The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, is a pest whose digestive
microbes are of considerable interest. This study describes the compartments of the O. rhinoceros
gut and compares their microbiomes using culturing-enriched metabarcoding. Beetle larvae were
collected from a coconut grove in southern Taiwan. Gut contents from the midgut and hindgut
were plated on nutrient agar and selective carboxymethylcellulose agar plates. {DNA} was extracted
from gut and fat body samples and 16S {rDNA} metabarcoding performed to identify unculturable
bacteria. Cellulase activity tests were performed on gut fluids and microbe isolates. The midgut
and hindgut both showed cellulolytic activity. Bacillus cereus, Citrobacter koseri, and the cellulolytic
fungus Candida xylanilytica were cultured from both gut sections in most larvae. Metabarcoding did
not find Bacillus cereus, and found that either Citrobacter koseri or Paracoccus sp. were the dominant
gut microbes in any given larva. No significant differences were found between midgut and hindgut
microbiomes. Bacillus cereus and Citrobacter koseri are common animal gut microbes frequently found
in Oryctes rhinoceros studies while Candida xylanilytica and the uncultured Paracoccus sp. had not been
identified in this insect before. Some or all of these may well have digestive functions for the beetle,
and are most likely acquired from the diet, meaning they may be transient commensalists rather than
obligate mutualists. Broader collection efforts and tests with antibiotics will resolve ambiguities in
the beetle–microbe interactions.},

In particular, viruses that replicate and assemble inside the nucleus have developed special approaches to modify the nuclear landscape for their advantage. We used electron microscopy to investigate cellular changes occurring during nudivirus infection and we characterized a unique mechanism for assembly, packaging, and transport of new virions across the nuclear membrane and through the cytoplasm. Our three-dimensional reconstructions describe the complex remodeling of the nuclear membrane necessary to release vesicle-associated viruses into the cytoplasm. This is the first report of nuclear morphological reconfigurations that occur during nudiviral infection.
{IMPORTANCE} The dynamics of nuclear envelope has a critical role in multiple cellular processes. However, little is known regarding the structural changes occurring inside the nucleus or at the inner and outer nuclear membranes. For viruses assembling inside the nucleus, remodeling of the intranuclear membrane plays an important role in the process of virion assembly. Here, we monitored the changes associated with viral infection in the case of nudiviruses. Our data revealed dramatic membrane remodeling inside the nuclear compartment during infection with Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, an important biocontrol agent against coconut rhinoceros beetle, a devastating pest for coconut and oil palm trees. Based on these findings, we propose a model for nudivirus assembly in which nuclear packaging occurs in fully enveloped virions.},

	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}, Oryctes rhinoceros) is a severe and invasive pest of coconut and other palms throughout Asia and the Pacific. The biocontrol agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}), has successfully suppressed O. rhinoceros populations for decades but new {CRB} invasions started appearing after 2007. A single-{SNP} variant within the mitochondrial cox1 gene is used to distinguish the recently-invading {CRB}-G lineage from other haplotypes, but the lack of mitogenome sequence for this species hinders further development of a molecular toolset for biosecurity and management programmes against {CRB}. Here we report the complete circular sequence and annotation for {CRB} mitogenome, generated to support such efforts. Sequencing data were generated using long-read Nanopore technology from genomic {DNA} isolated from a {CRB}-G female. The mitochondrial genome was assembled with Flye v.2.5, using the short-read Illumina sequences to remove homopolymers with Pilon, and annotated with {MITOS}. Independently-generated transcriptome data were used to assess the O. rhinoceros mitogenome annotation and transcription. The aligned sequences of 13 protein-coding genes ({PCGs}) (with degenerate third codon position) from O. rhinoceros, 13 other Scarabaeidae taxa and two outgroup taxa were used for the phylogenetic reconstruction with the Maximum likelihood ({ML}) approach in {IQ}-{TREE} and Bayesian ({BI}) approach in {MrBayes}.      The complete circular mitochondrial genome of O. rhinoceros is 20,898 bp-long, with a gene content canonical for insects (13 {PCGs}, 2 {rRNA} genes, and 22 {tRNA} genes), as well as one structural variation (rearrangement of {trnQ} and {trnI}) and a long control region (6,204 bp). Transcription was detected across all 37 genes, and interestingly, within three domains in the control region. {ML} and {BI} phylogenies had the same topology, correctly grouping O. rhinoceros with one other Dynastinae taxon, and recovering the previously reported relationship among lineages in the Scarabaeidae. In silico {PCR}-{RFLP} analysis recovered the correct fragment set that is diagnostic for the {CRB}-G haplogroup. These results validate the high-quality of the {CRB} mitogenome sequence and annotation.},

without a pheromone lure, indicating that the light sources act synergistically with

There was no significant difference in trap catch rate between traps equipped with
standard and reduced release rate lures, even though th release rate was reduced by an

	abstract = {Guam’s established population of non-native coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}, Oryctes rhinoceros L.) began creating burrows in stem apices of several cycad species in a managed garden. We conducted an island-wide survey to determine the spatial patterns of {CRB} burrowing of stems of in situ Cycas micronesica. We also measured starch of healthy and unhealthy coconut leaf tissue and compared this with starch of cycad stem tissue. The starch concentration of the central unexpanded leaf in healthy Philippine coconut trees was ≈90 mg·g−1, and that of unhealthy Guam coconut trees was ≈40 mg·g−1. The starch concentration of the tissue within the {CRB} burrow locations on C. micronesica trees was 145 mg·g−1. Burrowing of C. micronesica was restricted to female {CRB} adults and was found throughout the full latitudinal gradient of Guam. Our findings indicate Guam’s unhealthy coconut trees are no longer nutrient-dense, and the female {CRB} population may have exhibited a phylogenetically distant host shift to the abundant C. micronesica plants for a starch-rich diet within the concepts of the ‘ecological fitting’ hypothesis. We add proximity to coconut tree habitats as a new threat to Guam’s endangered C. micronesica population.},

The super parabolic vane traps proved to be effective in trapping large numbers of adult beetles. The pheromone sachets were found to have a life span of 60-80 days and equal number of both sexes of the beetles were captured. Use of pheromone traps were insufficient to control severe beetle infestations in the short term and properly monitored application of insecticidewas necessary to protect the palms. The traps were important for long term control when integrated with insecticieds and is an important component of the integrated pest management approach.},

	abstract = {This method can revolutionize current old school practices for Red Palm Weevil management, proposing much cheaper cost-effective and efficient monitoring and demonstrating that computer vision provides an efficient and practical solution for large scale monitoring of infested palm trees. The spread of the Red Palm Weevil has dramatically affected date growers, homeowners and governments, forcing them to deal with a constant threat to their palm trees. Early detection of palm tree infestation has been proven to be critical in order to allow treatment that may save trees from irreversible damage, and is most commonly performed by local physical access for individual tree monitoring. Here, we present a novel method for surveillance of Red Palm Weevil infested palm trees utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, with aerial and street-level imagery data. To detect infested palm trees we analyzed over 100,000 aerial and street-images, mapping the location of palm trees in urban areas. Using this procedure, we discovered and verified infested palm trees at various locations. We demonstrate that computer vision provides an efficient and practical solution for large scale monitoring of infested palm trees. The results indicate that by the use of publicly available online data and without a need of specialized equipment, the proposed framework can be used to automatically map palm trees at large scales and detect ones that are potentially infested . We show that the framework can be effective in both urban and open environments. This method can revolutionize current old school practices for Red Palm Weevil management, proposing much cheaper cost-effective and efficient monitoring. ∗kagandi@bgu.ac.il †fuhrmann@bgu.ac.il ‡mickyfi@bgu.ac.il 1 ar X iv :2 10 4. 02 59 8v 2 [ cs .C V ] 9 A pr 2 02 1},

	abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}), Oryctes rhinoceros L., is a serious pest of coconut and oil palms throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific. {CRB} was found on Guam in 2007 and, despite suppression efforts, has subsequently spread across the island. The {CRB} population on Guam is genetically different from other populations in Asia and the Pacific, and is considered a new invasive biotype (termed {CRB}-G). {CRB}-G is apparently resistant to Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, the preferred biocontrol agent for this pest. {CRB} populations are typically controlled with a combination of biocontrol, pheromone traps, and breeding site removal. A field trial was performed at six locations on Guam to test potential improvements to standard {CRB} pheromone trapping with oryctalure (ethyl 4-methyloctanoate). Two modifications were tested, 1) addition of ultraviolet light emitting diodes ({UV} {LEDs}), and 2) reduction of pheromone release rate. Addition of {UV} {LED} light sources to pheromone traps significantly increased trap catch by 2.85 times. Reduction in oryctalure release rate by up to an order of magnitude did not significantly change {CRB} capture rate. Further, when linear regression analyses of {CRB} trap capture rate as a function of pheromone release rate were conducted for traps with and without {UV} {LEDs} separately, only a very weak relationship between trap capture and oryctalure release rate was observed and only when a {UV} {LED} was present. Results suggest that addition of {UV} {LED} light sources to pheromone traps could improve detection trapping of {CRB} and that reduction of pheromone release rate could extend service life of lures without changing capture rate.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10886-021-01329-z},
	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus 1758) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae) ({CRB}), is endemic to tropical Asia where it damages both coconut and oil palm. A new invasion by {CRB} occurred on Guam in 2007 and eradication attempts failed using commonly applied Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}) isolates. This and subsequent invasive outbreaks were found to have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, {CRB}-G, which appeared to be tolerant to {OrNV}. The male-produced aggregation pheromone of the endemic, susceptible strain of O. rhinoceros ({CRB}-S) was previously identified as ethyl 4-methyloctanoate. Following reports from growers that commercial lures containing this compound were not attractive to {CRB}-G, the aim of this work was to identify the pheromone of {CRB}-G. Initial collections of volatiles from virgin male and female {CRB}-G adults from the Solomon Islands failed to show any male- or female-specific compounds as candidate pheromone components. Only after five months were significant quantities of ethyl 4-methyloctanoate and 4-methyloctanoic acid produced by males but not by females. No other male-specific compounds could be detected, in particular methyl 4-methyloctanoate, 4-methyl-1-octanol, or 4-methyl-1-octyl acetate, compounds identified in volatiles from some other species of Oryctes. Ethyl 4-methyloctanoate elicited a strong electroantennogram response from both male and female {CRB}-G, but these other compounds, including 4-methyloctanoic acid, did not. The enantiomers of ethyl 4-methyloctanoate and 4-methyloctanoic acid were conveniently prepared by enzymatic resolution of the commercially-available acid, and the enantiomers of the acid, but not the ester, could be separated by gas chromatography on an enantioselective cyclodextrin phase. Using this approach, both ethyl 4-methyloctanoate and 4-methyloctanoic acid produced by male {CRB}-G were shown to be exclusively the (R)-enantiomers whereas previous reports had suggested male O. rhinoceros produced the (S)-enantiomers. However, re-examination of the ester and acid produced by male {CRB}-S from Papua New Guinea showed that these were also the (R)-enantiomers. In field trapping experiments carried out in the Solomon Islands, both racemic and ethyl (R)-4-methyloctanoate were highly attractive to both male and female {CRB}-G beetles. The (S)-enantiomer and the corresponding acids were only weakly attractive. The addition of racemic 4-methyloctanoic acid to ethyl 4-methyloctanoate did significantly increase attractiveness, but the addition of (R)- or (S)-4-methyloctanoic acid to the corresponding ethyl esters did not. Possible reasons for the difference in assignment of configuration of the components of the {CRB} pheromone are discussed along with the practical implications of these results.},

We investigate several ways of how deep learning approaches can massively scan recordings of vibrations stemming from probed trees to infer their infestation state with wood-boring insects that feed and move inside wood. The recordings come from remotely controlled devices that sample the internal soundscape of trees on a 24/7 basis and wirelessly transmit brief recordings of the registered vibrations to a cloud server. We discuss the different sources of vibrations that can be picked up from trees in urban environments and how deep learning methods can focus on those originating from borers. Our goal is to match the problem of the accelerated—due to global trade and climate change— establishment of invasive xylophagus insects by increasing the capacity of inspection agencies. We aim at introducing permanent, cost-effective, automatic monitoring of trees based on deep learning techniques, in commodity entry points as well as in wild, urban and cultivated areas in order to effect large-scale, sustainable pest-risk analysis and management of wood boring insects such as those from the Cerambycidae family (longhorn beetles).},

	abstract = {An incipient population of Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle ({CRB}; Oryctes rhinoceros) was discovered on the island of Oahu in late 2013, posing a significant threat to the iconic palm trees and on the verge of migrating onto the other Hawaiian Islands and {US} Mainland. {CRB} surveillance and capture with traps deployed in remote and undeveloped areas are critical to contain and eradicate these invasive insects, but manual monitoring is laborious and resource-intensive. To improve the program's scalability, we are developing machine vision tools for trap-based surveillance systems to enable automatic {CRB} detection and {UAV}-based aerial imagery systems to allow automatic detection and characterization of {CRB} damage to palm trees. Both cloud-based and edge-based architectures are considered. The evaluations show that communication of trap images to a domain and inferencing on the cloud using effective {ConvNets} like {MobileNet} with Transfer learning for beetle detection is highly accurate (99\%) but bandwidth-intensive. Alternatively, an inference made locally on limited microcontroller memory using {TensorFlow} Lite, with inference results communicated through low data rate radio transmission, demonstrates reduced but acceptable detection accuracy (80 to 90\%) in the current prototypes. We plan to implement the latter approach on distributed wireless networks to automate {CRB} trap surveillance and analysis in remote areas.},

	abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}; Oryctes rhinoceros) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery and release of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}) in the 1960s and 70s suppressed the pest such that no new invasions of uninfested islands by {CRB} were reported for over 30years after implementation of the biocontrol programme. Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007), which could not be controlled by {OrNV}. Subsequently, new invasions have been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); O’ahu, Hawai’i (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, {CRB}-G, which appears to be tolerant to {OrNV}. {PCR} analysis shows that {OrNV} is generally present at high incidence in established populations of {CRB}, but is generally absent from the invasive {CRB}-G populations. {CRB}-G from Guam was not susceptible to {OrNV} infection by oral delivery, but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis shows that {CRB} populations can be divided into a number of clades that coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis suggests that {CRB}-G originated in Asia, though the precise location remains to be discovered.},

	abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after {WWII}. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a {US} Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. {OrNV} unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for {CRB} on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with {CRB}. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the {CRB} which invaded Guam belong to an {OrNV} resistant biotype named {CRB}-G which is involved in all recent invasions of {CRB} in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to {CRB} breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these {IPM} failures will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}) was first detected
on Guam during 2007. Following a failed eradication
program, we attempted to establish effective
microbial control using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus
({OrNV}) imported from {AgResearch} New Zealand
and green muscardine fungus ({GMF}), Metarhizium
majus, imported from the Philippine Coconut
Authority. {OrNV} was initially released by
autodissemination but did not result in population
suppression. Molecular analyses indicated that the
Guam population is genetically distinct from other
populations which had invaded Pacific Islands and
laboratory bioassays indicated that this genotype is
resistant to infection by {OrNV} isolates commonly
used and released in the Pacific region. This novel
biotype has been named {CRB} Biotype G ({CRB}-G) and
it is spreading throughout the Pacific. {GMF} was
released by autodissemination and incorporation of
spores into {CRB} breeding sites. An extensive post-
release survey indicated that field mortality from
{GMF} was between 10\% and 38\%. Population
suppression by {GMF} coupled with breeding site
sanitation and other integrated pest management
tactics did not prevent an uncontrolled island-wide
{CRB} outbreak triggered by Typhoon Dolphin which
passed over Guam in May 2015. Adults emerging
from abundant {CRB} breeding sites generated by this
typhoon were numerous enough to kill large
numbers of mature coconuts, initiating a positive
feedback cycle whereby adults emerging from dead
palms kill even more palms. History indicates that
the most feasible way to stop the current outbreak
on Guam is to find and release an {OrNV} isolate
which is pathogenic for {CRB}-G. We are currently
locating populations of {CRB}-G biotype within its
native range and looking for {OrNV} isolates from
these populations which can be used for effective
microbial control.},

The study was conducted in Asahan Regency, North Sumatera Province. Adult men, adult women, adolescent girls, and adolescent boys collected beetles for 2 hours in each breeding site. Results showed that the beetle was more significant abundant in decomposed trunks at plots of immature and mature palms than at heaps of the empty fruit bunches namely 236, 221 and 93 individuals/2 hours. The population age-structure showed significantly predominant of 2nd and 3rd instars in all breeding sites, i.e. eggs, 1st instars, 2nd instars, and 3rd instars, pupae, adult males, and adult females were 2.02, 23.29, 21.39, 47.06, 3.17, 0.86, and 2.21\%, respectively. Adult men, adult women, and adolescent boys had similar potency in collecting 3rd instar larvae while the least amount was collected by the adolescent girls viz. 70, 85, 60, and 38 larvae/2 hours, respectively.

Three search tactics for discovering breeding sites have been used with limited success: visual search by humans, search with assistance from detector dogs, and search by tracking {CRB} adults fitted with radio transmitters.Here we suggest a fourth search tactic: releasing {CRB} adults fitted with harmonic radar tags to locate breeding sites. Our idea is to find static end points for tags which accumulate at breeding sites, rather than active tracking of individual beetles. We plan to use commercially available hand-held harmonic radar devices. If we are successful, this technique may be useful for locating other insects which aggregate, such as hornets and other social insects.},

	abstract = {Oryctes monoceros is a serious coconut pest, causing up to 40\% damage in tropical Africa. Synthetic aggregation pheromone, ethyl 4-methyloctanoate, has been used to lure adults to traps. Traps with pheromone plus decaying palm material captured a high proportion of males. This raises the question whether individuals, which damage palms are receptive to the pheromone. We studied the sex ratio of the insects feeding on coconuts and those attracted to pheromone traps. Sixty two percent of adults from feeding galleries on living coconut palms were females. Pheromone with rotting palm material lured 43\% females. To investigate the reasons for this difference, we compared the reproductive system of females lured to the odour traps or feeding in coconut galleries, or present in old rotting stems. Ninety six percent of the females trapped by pheromone had mated, and were sexually mature. In the galleries on living palms, 46\% of females were immature, and 24\% had not mated. In old rotting stems where eggs are laid and larvae develop, a mixture of 52\% mated and 48\% virgin females was found. Therefore, the pheromone together with the odour of rotting coconut stems signals a reproduction site to beetles, particularly mature females. In practice, the pheromone-baited traps will help in reducing the dissemination of gravid females, but will not affect directly the numbers of immature ones attacking palms. Our results show that when using pheromones for monitoring or controlling insects, the physiological status of the insects may have unexpected effects on the outcome.},

	abstract = {It is now more than 100 years since the coconut rhinoceros beetle ({CRB}: Oryctes rhinoceros L.) was first detected in the Pacific Island state of Samoa. The exotic pest from Asia became the principal pest of coconut palms in Samoa and, from this first point of invasion, spread to several surrounding countries in the South-West Pacific Ocean. An intensive control operation was initiated, but the beetle could not be eliminated. Various pest management strategies were attempted but had limited success until the introduction of a biological control agent ({BCA}), Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus ({OrNV}), during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The biocontrol release was very successful and became the prime example of “classical biological control” of an insect pest by a virus. Changing economic and social conditions in Samoa and other islands of the Pacific require a re-evaluation of the threat of {CRB} to coconut production to suggest how the {IPM} system may be modified to meet future needs. Therefore, it is timely to review the history of {CRB} in Samoa and summarize experiences in development of an integrated pest management ({IPM}) system limiting the impact of the pest. We also present results from a recent study conducted in 2020 on the island of Upolu to define the current status of the {CRB} population and its {BCA}, {OrNV}. The lessons from Samoa, with its long history of containment and management of {CRB}, are applicable to more recent invasion sites. Recommendations are provided to modify the {IPM} programme to enhance the sustainable control of {CRB} and support the ongoing coconut replantation program promoted by the Samoan government.},
